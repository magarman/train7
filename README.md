### New things learned
The aria-describedby: This attribute is used to indicate the IDs of the elements that describe the object. It is used to establish a relationship between widgets or groups and text that described them.

### Errors fixed
1. I kept getting undefined on all the objects - PreventDefulat had a lowercase "D"

### What was used to create the app:
1. Moment.js
2. Firebase
3. JQuery
4. Bootstrap
5. HTML & CSS
